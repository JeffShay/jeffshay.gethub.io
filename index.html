        <h3>Web Page Development</h3>
        <p>This was actually part of my bachelor's degree program and was something that i enjoyed very much. I had a few friends on a very low start up budget that did not have start up money, so i designed them a website for free mainly for the
          experience and to help out my portfolio.</p>
